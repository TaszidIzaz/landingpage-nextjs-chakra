The app folder holds all the important files and is considered to be the most important folder in the next 13.

  =>  1. The app folder contains layout file which is UI that is shared between multiple pages.
        On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. Layouts can also be nested.
        The file is considered to be the Great Great Grandfather of all files . All of the projects content goes through this file.

  =>  2.The page file is UI that is unique to a route. it holds all the sections in that specific app directory

  =>  3. In my created app i have added sign in and sign out files which also reside in side the app folder.
        he sign in and sign out files also contain the nav bar and the footer section as they are inside the app folder.


other files: 

public  - 	Static assets to be served

next.config.js  - 	Configuration file for Next.js    

package.json -	Project dependencies and scripts

.gitignore  -  Git files and folders to ignore

.next-env.d.ts	-  TypeScript declaration file for Next.js

tsconfig.json	-  Configuration file for TypeScript



These are all the important files for the next js app. The other node node_modules and other files contain 
the dependencies and modules for the project. I have used Chakra UI and Chakra Template to make the whole project.
